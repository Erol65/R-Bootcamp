In the image below you can see that a script called `ggplot-sample.R` is open on the top-left corner and after executing its content the same code will automatically be copied to the console and run from there. We can still use console for testing and running our ad-hoc code, then move it to the script once finalized. \n",

    "## Projects\n",
    "Now that we are writing our code in scripts let's use an effective way to organize all the project dependencies and create an environment that facilitates collaboration. RStudio comes with a *Project* concept that can handle a lot of our work, especially when in collaboration with others. In the image above on the very top-right you can see that Project is set to nothing; **Project: (None)**. In this section we will learn how to set up  a project environment and how it can be helpful in a longer term.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb we should always have everything related to a project under one parent directory, everything else goes under child directories. Imagine a hierarchy similar to the one below\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../png/project-hierarchy.png\" width=\"500px\" align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the parent (project) directory is called `My-First-Project` and it consists of several child directories, which they can have their own child directories. For instance source directory can contain directories such as `sandbox`, `demo`, `main`, etc. It's always a good practice to maintain a `README.md` file in the parent directory and keep it up to date; this file is a good place for giving a high-level overview of what is inside this project, how to get it run, and who to reach for getting more information or report bugs. It is also a good practice to keep a `README.md` file in the immediate directories under parent, for instance one that describes what utility scripts are available under `util` and how to run them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would like others be able to run our code, that's why we want to keep everything in one place. Using Git or other code sharing tools we let other people access it. There are many occasions that we will reference to data files (for reading data into the memory), or other code files. This can be tricky since the \"absolute\" location of the code in my computer will be different than yours. This is where R project comes to rescue. If everyone is using the project environment then we can use a \"relative\" path to access other files. All we need to do is to use the relative paths (starting from parent directory) and all others need to follow is to run the code using the project environment. This is an example of information that could go into `README.md`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the hierarchy above, we see the `My-First-Project.Rproj` which is our R project. This was made by clicking on the arrow next to **Project: (None)**, and an existing directory. If it's a brand new project you can create the parent directory from there as well. One can also *clone* from a `git` repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "The above file structure example can be found under the `solution` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For initiating your R environment from a project there are several ways, here are the two most handy ones:\n",
    "* Click on the `.Rproj` file and RStudio will open your project\n",
    "* From an existing RStudio session click on the arrow next to **Project: (None)** to open your Rproj. RStudio will remember your last projects, so you can also select it from there as well if you see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice\n",
    "Now that we know how to work in a project setting let's open our project by opening an R session from `R-Bootcamp.Rproj` in the parent directory. There is no need to create a new project since I have already done that, but would be a good practice to create a sample project outside of the R-Bootcamp folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see many examples of using relative paths in Data Import notebook, here is an example:\n",

    "\n",
