    "R Markdown provides a unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results, and your commentary all from RStudio. R Markdown documents are reproducible and can be exported as many typical document formats such as PDF, HTML, slide shows, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:\n",
    "1. For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.\n",
    "2. For collaborating with other data scientists (including future you!).\n",
    "3. As an environment in which to do data science, as a modern day lab notebook where you can capture not only what you did, but also what you were thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "R Markdown uses a number of R packages as well as some external tools. Because of this our regular help, `?`, will not be as useful as you saw for other packages. To get help use the following resources:\n",
    "* *rmarkdown-2.0* Cheatsheet \n",
