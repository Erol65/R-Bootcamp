    "### Coding environment <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"codeEnv\"></a>\n",
    "Typically, we use a secondary environment to write R code. There are various options but by far the most popular one is RStudio and that's what we will mainly use throughout this course. Some of the advantages of using an IDE such as RStudio is that we have access to all the environment variables, and can write, run, and debug an R script, look up the help documentation, and plot interactive charts all in one single window. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will present the material using Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks allow one to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Later on this page you will learn how to run these notebooks, but the primary goal of this course is to learn programming with R and the powerful functionalities of RStudio.\n",

    "All the code shared on the upcoming notebooks can be run by copy/paste into RStudio on your personal computer. Another option could be to run these notebooks directly using Jupyter. All the original notebooks are located in the `notebooks` directory, and if you have Jupyter and R (add-on to Jupyter) installed on your computer you can simply run them without the need to copy them to an R/RStudio environment. If you don't have Jupyter installed, the simplest way to run these notebooks is to use the **Binder** environment that I have created for you. It is as simple as clicking on a URL, the details are in the next section. You can also find resources on how to install Jupyer at the end of the page, but please have in mind that this is an entirely optional step and you can finish this bootcamp without it.\n",

Binder will automatically shut down user sessions that have more than 10 minutes of inactivity (if you leave your window open, this will be counted as \"activity\"). Binder aims to provide at least 12 hours of session time per user session. So, have this in mind that your work will be deleted after your session expires. It is mainly designed to follow along a lecture, and not to be used for running homework/project code. By having that in mind one could use it cautiously by exporting code and data at the end of each work session (before it expires), Jupyter gives you the functionality to save them locally. Though, it is considered risky and you could potentially loose your work.\n",

    "Your container comes pre-installed with all the packages that we will be using throughout this bootcamp, so no need to install them, just load them. It allows you to install new libraries if you need to. Feel free to play around and do whatever you like in your container, it's your own temporary cloud environment and won't affect the work of your classmates. If anything breaks you can simply close the tab that you were running binder and open a new one, starting with a fresh environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another nice feature that Binder provides is RStudio. You can access an RStudio session through Binder and it will give you one in your browser. The same risk applies to this as well, in fact this RStudio session is within the same container that allows you to launch Jupyter notebooks which is nice. If you install a specific R package in one you don't need to redo it in the other one. To start a new RStudio session through binder click on *RStudio Session* under *New*:\n",
