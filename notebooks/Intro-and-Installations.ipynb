Some of the advantages of using an IDE such as RStudio is that we have access to all the environment variables, and can write, run, and debug an R script, look up the help documentation, and plot interactive charts all in one single window. \n",

    "All the code shared on the upcoming notebooks can be run by copy/paste into RStudio on your personal computer. Another option could be to run these notebooks directly using Jupyter. All the original notebooks are located in the `notebooks` directory, and if you have Jupyter and R (add-on to Jupyter) installed on your computer you can simply run them without the need to copy them to an R/RStudio environment. If you don't have Jupyter installed, the simplest way to run these notebooks is to use the **Binder** environment that I have created for you. It is as simple as clicking on a URL, the details are in the next section. You can also find resources on how to install Jupyer at the end of the page, but please have in mind that this is an entirely optional step and you can finish this bootcamp without it.\n",

Binder will automatically shut down user sessions that have more than 10 minutes of inactivity (if you leave your window open, this will be counted as \"activity\"). Binder aims to provide at least 12 hours of session time per user session. So, have this in mind that your work will be deleted after your session expires. It is mainly designed to follow along a lecture, and not to be used for running homework/project code. Of course Jupyter gives you the functionality to download your code as well as data and save it locally. If you would like to use Binder to perform your projects you can certainly do that and export before you close your laptop, but it is considered risky and you could potentially loose your work.\n",

It allows you to install new libraries if you need to.

If anything breaks you can simply close the tab that you were running binder and open a new one, starting with a fresh environment.\n",

    "Another nice feature that Binder provides is RStudio. You can access an RStudio session through Binder and it will give you one in your browser. The same risk applies to this as well, in fact this RStudio session is within the same container that allows you to launch Jupyter notebooks which is nice. If you install a specific R package in one you don't need to redo it in the other one. To start a new RStudio session through binder click on *RStudio Session* under *New*:\n",
