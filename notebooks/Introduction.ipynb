    "Throughout this course we will be using *R for Data Science* book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. Many of the concept definitions, examples, and images in these notebook series are directly taken from Hadley's book, typically with some modifications. For a deeper understanding I recommend reading his book. You can get access to the electronic copy for free [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Please note that the order of the materials does not necessarily coincide with the notebooks.\n",

    "We will touch on all of these modules separately in the upcoming notebooks and work with some of the most popular tools to answer questions about our data. You'll use these tools in every data science project, but for most projects they're not enough. There's a rough 80-20 rule at play; you can tackle about 80% of every project using the tools that you'll learn here, but you'll need other tools to tackle the remaining 20% which could vary based on the problem."
