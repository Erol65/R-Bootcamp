# R-Bootcamp

Throughout this bootcamp you will learn the basics of R programming, as well as some of its more advanced functionalities. You will be introduced to a handful of most popular libraries for data analysis in R, such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr`, and `rmarkdown`. These packages will facilitate the workflow and enhance the basic R functionalities; using them, one can effortlessly clean up the dataset, create elaborate plots, analyze and summarize the data, and produce presentable reports. In the end, you will learn the basic concepts of machine learning, use some of the well-known algorithms, and perform predictions on various data sources, applying the skills you just learned. You will be given the opportunity to live-code during the class and troubleshoot your code with your classmates and the instructor. You will walk out of this bootcamp with more confidence in your R skills, a general understanding of powerful tools offered in R, and having resources in hand for learning more.

### Coding environment <a class="anchor" id="codeEnv"></a>
Typically, we use a secondary environment to write R code. There are various options but by far the most popular one is RStudio and that's what we will mainly use throughout this course. Some of the advantages of using an IDE such as RStudio is that we have access to all the environment variables, and can write, run, and debug an R script, look up the help documentation, and plot interactive charts all in one single window.

I will present the material using Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks allow one to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Later on this page you will learn how to run these notebooks, but the primary goal of this course is to learn programming with R and the powerful functionalities of RStudio.

This repository consists of notebooks located in notebooks directory, equivalent html files in html directory, and cheatsheets.

**Binder** makes it simple to generate reproducible computing environments from a Git repository. Binder uses the BinderHub technology to generate a Docker image from this repository with all the required libraries pre-installed. All the notebooks in the repository will be accessible. You can spin off your own Binder container by going to https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/soltaniehha/R-Bootcamp/master or by clicking on the binder logo below:

Another nice feature that Binder provides is RStudio. To start a new RStudio session through binder click on *RStudio Session* under *New*.
